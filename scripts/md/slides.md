title: Blank screen, "503 Service not available"

* PHP errors (Syntax error, Memory, Outdated Autoloads, ...)
* Configuration errors (DB connection, ...)

* Switch to DEV mode for better debugging
* Check the log files
<pre>
    Apache/PHP Log
    ezpublish/logs/&lt;env&gt;.log
    ezpublish_legacy/var/log/\*
    ezpublish_legacy/var/&lt;siteaccess&gt;/log/\*
</pre>
* Check write permissions on log files!

---

title: TwigBundle:Exception:error500.html.twig

* NEVER a Twig error!
* Caused by response 500 "Internal Server Error" and missing error template

* Checks as before

---

title: Twig Exception: Invalid variation "&lt;variation&gt;"

Caused by problems when accessing images

* Check if the file exists
* Check permissions on `ezpublish_legacy/var/<siteaccess>/storage`
* Check log files
* Clear cache

---

title: Class 'ezxFormToken' not found

* Usually found with fresh installations involving legacy extensions
* Regenerate Autoloads

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="bash">
$ cd ezpublish_legacy
$ php bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php -e -p
</pre>

title: Pitfalls
subtitle: Avoid the traps...
class: segue dark nobackground

---

title: Memory limit exceeded in DEV mode

* DEV mode takes a lot of memory
* Stash Logging is the worst
* Disable Stash Logging in ezpublish.yml

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="yml">
stash:
    <b>logging: false</b>
    caches:
        default:
            handlers:
                - FileSystem
            inMemory: true
            registerDoctrineAdapter: false
</pre>

title: 414 Request-URI Too Long

When doing subrequests, particularly ESI or Hinclude ones, current SiteAccess is transmitted in a serialized form, with its matcher. With a large number of configured SiteAccesses using Map\Host or Map\URI matcher (around 40, which is not uncommon for a multi-national, multi-lingual site) the URL can exceed the size of 8192 Bytes which most servers accept. As a result, the ESI/Hinclude call fails.

* Fixed in Version 5.3.3 (2014.07)
* <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-23168>
* <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/949>

title: eZ View Cache vs. HTTP Caching
subtitle:
class: segue dark nobackground

---

title: eZ View Caching

When the pagelayout is rendered, the `{$module_result.content}` part will be replaced with the actual output. If view caching is enabled, the entire result of the module will be cached. This means that the contents of the "module_result" variable will be put into a cache file (...)

When a new version (...) of an object is published, the system will automatically clear the view cache for the following items:

* All published nodes of the object
* The parent nodes
* Related nodes (keywords, object relations)

<https://doc.ez.no/eZ-Publish/Technical-manual/4.x/Features/View-caching>

---

title: HTTP Expiration and Validation

The HTTP specification defines two caching models:

* With the **expiration model**, you simply specify how long a response should be considered "fresh" by including a Cache-Control and/or an Expires header. Caches that understand expiration will not make the same request until the cached version reaches its expiration time and becomes "stale";
* When pages are really dynamic (i.e. their representation changes often), the **validation model** is often necessary. With this model, the cache stores the response, but asks the server on each request whether or not the cached response is still valid. The application uses a unique response identifier (the Etag header) and/or a timestamp (the Last-Modified header) to check if the page has changed since being cached.

<http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/http_cache.html>

---

title: In Short (and much simplified...)

eZ View Cache caches **content** and **content fragements**

* Standard TTL is 2 hours
* Is purged on content modifications (with smart cache clearing rules)

Symfony's HTTP Cache caches **requests**

* eZ uses Expiration model by default
* Standard TTL is 60 seconds (86400 for tree menu!)
* Symfony Cache is purged from backend, **but only for ONE location**

Let's dive in a bit deeper...

---

title: ez 4 Cache Directives

Code from `ezpublish_legacy/kernel/private/classes/ezpkernelweb.php`

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="php">
// send header information
foreach (
    eZHTTPHeader::headerOverrideArray( $this->uri ) +
    array(
        <b>'Expires' => 'Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT',
        'Last-Modified' => gmdate( 'D, d M Y H:i:s' ) . ' GMT',
        'Cache-Control' => 'no-cache, must-revalidate',
        'Pragma' => 'no-cache',</b>
        ...
      ) as $key => $value
)
{
    header( $key . ': ' . $value );
}
</pre>

**This guarantees that every request is handled by eZ**

---

title: eZ 5 Cache Directives

Code from `vendor/ezsystems/demobundle/EzSystems/DemoBundle/Controller/DemoController.php`

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="php">
// Setting HTTP cache for the response to be public and with a TTL of 1 day.
$response = new Response;
$response->setPublic();
$response->setSharedMaxAge( 86400 );
// Menu will expire when top location cache expires.
$response->headers->set( 'X-Location-Id', $rootLocationId );
// Menu might vary depending on user permissions, so make the cache vary on the user hash.
$response->setVary( 'X-User-Hash' );
</pre>

**This effectively sets the Response free, out of the reach of eZ**

---

title: Emulating eZ 4 Cache behaviour in eZ 5

This patch to `index.php` disables client and proxy caching without sacrifying the benefits of the Symfony HTTP cache. Use at own risk!

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="php">
$response = $kernel->handle( $request );
<b>
// Emulate eZ 4 cache control
$response->headers->set( 'Cache-Control', 'no-cache, must-revalidate' );
</b>
$response->send();
$kernel->terminate( $request, $response );
</pre>

---

title: Cache Recommendations

* Read the specifications
* Use Shared Caches with caution
* Set TTL values low enough
* Cave: `setTtl()` vs. `setClientTtl`
* For higher traffic sites, use Varnish

* <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#page-74>
* <https://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/>

title: Multi-Site/Multi-Repository Setup
subtitle:
class: segue dark nobackground

---

title: Why a Multi-Site/Multi-Repository Setup?

* At CJW Network we have developed a multi-site/multi-repository setup for eZ Publish 4 several years ago
* This allows us to host many individual sites on a single eZ Publish installation

Advantages:

* Central site administration (site activation, cronjobs, ...)
* Easy deployment (update site extension with Subversion)
* Highly reduced maintenance costs (security patches, upgrades)
* Highly efficient use of hardware resources

Disadvantages:

* Some Kernel patches needed

---

title: Multi-Site/Multi-Repository Setup in eZ 5

First Approach (proven in production)

* Use different `ezpublish` directories to host the different sites

Second approach (under development)

* Use `CJW MultiSiteBundle`

---

title: TODO EKKE

---

title: Introducing CJW MultiSiteBundle
build_lists: true

Although the first approach works fine, it has several drawbacks:

* Application code scattered at different places (site directory, bundle, legacy extension), hard to maintain in VCS, hard to deploy
* Redundancy in config files
* No global settings
* No central site activation/administration

Goal: keep everything in one place!

---

title: CJW MultiSiteBundle Features

* Boots kernel and environment based on domain name mappings
* Allows for global activation of bundles
* Allows for global settings
* Provides a common console for all sites
* Caches domain name mappings
* Moves cache and log files away from the ezpublish folder
* more to come ...

title: cjwpublish Directory

The `cjwpublish` application directory sits next to the `ezpublish` directory.

<pre class="">
cjwpublish
&#8990; config
    cjwpublish.yml                  &lt;-- defines active bundles
    config.yml                      &lt;-- allows for global settings
  CjwPublishKernel.php              &lt;-- inherits from CjwMultiSiteKernel.php
  CjwPublishCache.php               &lt;-- inherits from CjwMultiSiteCache.php
  console
</pre>

---

title: Symfony's app directory is back

Site Bundle Directory Layout

<pre class="">
src
&#8990; Cjw
  &#8990; SiteExample
    &#8990; app
      &#8990; config
          cjwpublish.yml            &lt;-- contains domain mappings
          config.yml
          ezpublish.yml
          ...
        CjwSiteExampleKernel.php    &lt;-- inherits from CjwPublishKernel.php
        CjwSiteExampleCache.php     &lt;-- inherits from CjwPublishCache.php
    &#8990; Controller
      ...
</pre>

---

title: Caveats

Adjustments needed in `config.yml` to reflect different relative location of kernel

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="yml">
assetic:
    ...
    read_from:      %kernel.root_dir%/../../../../web
    write_to:       %kernel.root_dir%/../../../../web
    ...
ez_publish_legacy:
    ...
    root_dir: %kernel.root_dir%/../../../../ezpublish_legacy

parameters:
    ezpublish.kernel.root_dir: %kernel.root_dir%/../../../../vendor/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel
</pre>

**More problems of this kind expected!**
