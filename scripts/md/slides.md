title: Multiple Colors of Migration
build_lists: true

- There are still many (too much) eZ Publish legacy sites 
- eZ Publish 5.4 / 2014.11 is supported until May 2019
- So there is a stable business base for the next 4 years
- And since one year in internet is seven years in real live, 28 years of best business!
- **Why waiting? OK, we try to help you with arguments and know how**

- Run legacy only
- Run Symfony only
- Your fast (easy) way to pure Symfony
-

title: Why waiting?
subtitle: Pro and cons

title: Why waiting?
subtitle: Financial reasons - How to sell it to your customer?
build_lists: true


- update / upgrade - but still no new feature for editors
- many security fixes - but often part of maintenance support

- Relaunch: Make responsive, look at <http://getbootstrap.com> or <http://foundation.zurb.com/>
- Relaunch: Mobile first, it is coming to marketing people
- new feature mobile editing
- Do you have one more?

---

title: Why waiting?
subtitle: Technical reasons for starting now
build_lists: true


- it is on the upgrade path to eZ Plattform 6
- many security and bug fixes
- TWIG for new templates and fallback to old templates when needed
- easy to extend with Symfony bundles, there are more than 2500 on e.g. <http://knpbundles.com/>
- switch to responsive web design and make it mobile first

---

title: Which version to use?
subtitle: We need a version as a stable base for the next 4 years
build_lists: true

- eZ Publish 5.3 / 5.4 aka 2014.11 is supported until May 2019
- but many fixes are in the legacy bridge (-)
- but newer versions are pre alpha (+)
- but there is no real save version to switch (-)
- solution take our cjwpublish and help to keep it fresh (+)

title: Run legacy only

title: Run legacy only 
subtitle: Short introduction
build_lists: true

- if you only need the bug fixes and security patches in legacy
- our arguments won't convince you or your customer
- the installation has more than 150 extensions
- then link your requests into the legacy folder
- go the upgrade path <https://doc.ez.no/display/EZP/Upgrade>
- and read more <https://doc.ez.no/display/EZP/Legacy+code+and+features>
- but we advice you to go to "Run Symfony only"

title: Team up with a Symfony Crack
build_lists: true

- To be honest: as eZ 4 developers, we are complete novices in eZ 5
- It's easier for a Smyfony Crack to learn eZ than other way round
- Symfony community is hungry for a CMS, so watch out for new competition
- But @Symfony cracks: It's not easy: an eZ Publish and CMS expert will reduce your risk
- And will make your content architecture better and more maintainable
- **OR take the shortcut for integrators**

title: TODO, aus 2014 Multi-Site/Multi-Repository Setup
subtitle:
class: segue dark nobackground

---

title: Why a Multi-Site/Multi-Repository Setup?

* At CJW Network we have developed a multi-site/multi-repository setup for eZ Publish 4 several years ago
* This allows us to host many individual sites on a single eZ Publish installation

Advantages:

* Central site administration (site activation, cronjobs, ...)
* Easy deployment (update site extension with Subversion)
* Highly reduced maintenance costs (security patches, upgrades)
* Highly efficient use of hardware resources

Disadvantages:

* Some Kernel patches needed

---

title: TODO, aus 2014Multi-Site/Multi-Repository Setup in eZ 5
build_lists: fade


*First Approach (proven in production and depreciated)*

*  *Use different ezpublish app directories to host the different sites*


**Second approach (proven in production)**

* Use TODO ab hier bitte Ã¼berarbeiten: `CJW MultiSiteBundle`

---

title: TODO, aus 2014Introducing CJW MultiSiteBundle
build_lists: true

Although the first approach works fine, it has several drawbacks:

* Application code scattered at different places (site directory, bundle, legacy extension), hard to maintain in VCS, hard to deploy
* Redundancy in config files
* No global settings
* No central site activation/administration

* Goal: keep everything in one place!

---

title: TODO, aus 2014CJW MultiSiteBundle Features
build_lists: true

* Boots kernel and environment based on domain name mappings
* Handles local, staging and live domain names
* Allows for global activation of bundles
* Allows for global settings
* Provides a common console for all sites
* Caches domain name mappings
* Moves cache and log files away from the ezpublish folder
* more to come ...

---

title: TODO, aus 2014cjwpublish Directory

The `cjwpublish` application directory sits next to the `ezpublish` directory.

<pre class="">
cjwpublish
&#8990; config
    cjwpublish.yml                  &lt;-- defines active bundles
    config.yml                      &lt;-- allows for global settings
  CjwPublishKernel.php              &lt;-- inherits from CjwMultiSiteKernel.php
  CjwPublishCache.php               &lt;-- inherits from CjwMultiSiteCache.php
  console
</pre>

---

title: TODO, aus 2014Symfony's app directory is back

Site Bundle Directory Layout

<pre class="">
src
&#8990; Cjw
  &#8990; SiteExampleBundle
    &#8990; app
      &#8990; config
          cjwpublish.yml            &lt;-- contains domain mappings
          config.yml
          ezpublish.yml
          ...
        CjwSiteExampleKernel.php    &lt;-- inherits from CjwPublishKernel.php
        CjwSiteExampleCache.php     &lt;-- inherits from CjwPublishCache.php
    &#8990; Controller
      ...
</pre>

---

title: TODO, aus 2014Caveats

Adjustments needed in `config.yml` to reflect different relative location of kernel

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="yml">
assetic:
    ...
    read_from:      %kernel.root_dir%/../../../../web
    write_to:       %kernel.root_dir%/../../../../web
    ...
ez_publish_legacy:
    ...
    root_dir: %kernel.root_dir%/../../../../ezpublish_legacy

parameters:
    ezpublish.kernel.root_dir: %kernel.root_dir%/../../../../vendor/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel
</pre>

**More problems of this kind expected!**
