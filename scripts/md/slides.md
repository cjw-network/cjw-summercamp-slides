title: Learnings from Real eZ Publish 5 Projects
class: big
build_lists: true

- Last year we have presented our Cookbok...
- ... today you get a Ratatouille ;-)

- Let's share the experiences you and we made in the last year!

---

title: Agenda
class: big
build_lists: true

Things we would like to discuss:

- Good Practice
- ez View Cache vs. HTTP Cache
- Debugging
- Pitfalls
- MultiSite Setup

---

title: Good Practice
subtitle:
class: segue dark nobackground

---

title: Team up with a Symfony Crack

- To be honest: as eZ 4 developers, we are complete novices in eZ 5
- It's easier for a Smyfony Crack to learn eZ than other way round
- Symfony community is hungry for a CMS, so watch out for new competition

---

title: Think in MVC

- A radical different thinking
- eZ 4 mangeled all together in the TPL -&gt; the view implemented the logic (fetch)
- Symfony enforces a clean separation, from routing to the controller to the rendering of the view

---

title: Think in Bundles

- Split your application in different bundles (site specific, functional, ...)
- Reuse your code: create and maintain a Base Bundle with general functions

Creating bundles is easy, don't work in the DemoBundle ;-)

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="bash">
$ php ezpublish/console generate:bundle
</pr>

---

title: Organize your config files

- The standard eZ installation is a mess...
- ... and the DemoBundle only slowly becoming a source of good practice

Our approach

- keep config in `ezpublish/config` as general as possible
- it should merely decribe your environment, not the application
- move all site/function specific settings to the bundle

---

title: Keep ezpublish.yml small

`ezpublish/config/ezpublish.yml`

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="yml">
imports:
    - {resource: "@CjwExampleBundle/Resources/config/ezpublish.yml"}
</pre>

Keep these sections:

- doctrine (Database)
- ezpublish (Siteaccess Matching, Siteaccesses, Languages, Caching)
- stash

Can even be shorter - get inspiration from <https://github.com/lolautruche/metalfrance>

*Note: prepending configuration does not work well with parameters*

---

title: Config Files in Bundle

We keep them in a separate directory and name them as in good old eZ...

<pre>
ExampleBundle
&#8990; Resources
  &#8990; config
    &#8990; ezpublish
        image.yml
        override.yml
      ezpublish.yml
      parameters.yml
      routing.yml
      services.yml
</pre>

---

title: Controllers

After several tries, we ended up with...

- Basically one controller per full view
- Separate controllers for navigation etc.
- Retrieve all needed data (location, children, ...)
- Prepare the data for easy processing in the templates
- Consider caching (TTL, X-Location Header)

---

title: Ways to Fetch Content

- SearchService::findContent()
- SearchService::findLocations()

- LocationService::loadLocationChildren()

- Legacy fetch functions

---

title: SearchService::findContent()
build_lists: true

The only `SearchService` function you will find in `DemoBundle`

- returns full `content` objects with ALL attributes in ALL languages
- scales very badly
- no `asObjects` flag as in eZ 4

- fetching a content tree with 116 locations took 30 seconds
- most of the time is spent in manipulating the SQL result in PHP
- Another test: 24 hits, PHP array 44'880 rows with 39 elements each, highly redundant

<http://share.ez.no/blogs/donat-fritschy/searchservice-performance>

---

title: SearchService::findLocations()
build_lists: true

**Available from 2014.05 / 5.3 only**

Roughly equivalent to good old `fetch( 'content', 'list' )`

- returns `location` objects with `contentInfo` only
- fetching a content tree with 116 locations took &lt; 1 second

---

title: LocationService::loadLocationChildren()

&laquo;Think of `LocationService::loadLocationChildren()` as primarily intended for administration interface.&raquo;

&laquo;If what it offers suits you for the frontend as well, great, but otherwise you will have to use SearchService. In other words, this method will not get filtering capabilities.&raquo;

*(From a discussion with Petar)*

<http://www.netgenlabs.com/Blog/Fetching-content-in-eZ-Publish-5-using-Search-service>

---

title: Legacy Fetch Functions
class: smaller

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="php">
use eZFunctionHandler;
...
$mySearchResults = $this->getLegacyKernel()->runCallback(
    function () use ( $searchPhrase, $sort, $contentTypeIdenfiers )
    {
        // eZFunctionHandler::execute is the equivalent for a legacy template fetch function
        // The following is the same than fetch( 'ezfind', 'search', hash(...) )
        return eZFunctionHandler::execute(
            'ezfind',
            'search',
            array(
                'query'     => $searchPhrase,
                'sort_by'   => $sort,
                'class_id'  => $contentTypeIdenfiers
            )
        );
    }
);
</pre>

---

title: TWIG Templates

- A generalized full and line view template for the easy stuff
- And again, basically one template per full view


How to hande children (sub items)?

- render directly in the template - the data is usally already there
- use `{{ render( controller( 'ez_content:viewLocation', {'locationId': child.id, 'viewType': 'line'} )) }}`

When to use ESI?

- nice concept, but quite a big overhead
- better suited for larger chunks

---

title: How to organize Templates?

The Symfony way...

<pre>
views
&#8990; Customer
    CustomerDetail.html.twig
&#8990; Product
</pre>

The classic eZ way...

<pre>
views
&#8990; full
    customer.html.twig
&#8990; line
</pre>

Two approaches, both valid. Follow your taste.

---

title: eZ View Cache vs. HTTP Caching
subtitle:
class: segue dark nobackground

---

title: eZ View Caching

When the pagelayout is rendered, the `{$module_result.content}` part will be replaced with the actual output. If view caching is enabled, the entire result of the module will be cached. This means that the contents of the "module_result" variable will be put into a cache file (...)

When a new version (...) of an object is published, the system will automatically clear the view cache for the following items:

* All published nodes of the object
* The parent nodes
* Related nodes (keywords, object relations)

<https://doc.ez.no/eZ-Publish/Technical-manual/4.x/Features/View-caching>

---

title: HTTP Expiration and Validation
build_lists: true

The HTTP specification defines two caching models:

* With the **expiration model**, you simply specify how long a response should be considered "fresh" by including a Cache-Control and/or an Expires header. Caches that understand expiration will not make the same request until the cached version reaches its expiration time and becomes "stale";
* When pages are really dynamic (i.e. their representation changes often), the **validation model** is often necessary. With this model, the cache stores the response, but asks the server on each request whether or not the cached response is still valid. The application uses a unique response identifier (the Etag header) and/or a timestamp (the Last-Modified header) to check if the page has changed since being cached.

<http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/http_cache.html>

---

title: In Short (and much simplified...)

eZ View Cache caches **content** and **content fragements**

* Standard TTL is 2 hours
* Is purged on content modifications (with smart cache clearing rules)

Symfony's HTTP Cache caches **requests**

* eZ uses Expiration model by default
* Standard TTL is 60 seconds (86400 for tree menu!)
* Symfony Cache is purged from backend, **but only for ONE location**

Let's dive in a bit deeper...

---

title: ez 4 Cache Directives

Code from `ezpublish_legacy/kernel/private/classes/ezpkernelweb.php`

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="php">
// send header information
foreach (
    eZHTTPHeader::headerOverrideArray( $this->uri ) +
    array(
        <b>'Expires' => 'Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT',
        'Last-Modified' => gmdate( 'D, d M Y H:i:s' ) . ' GMT',
        'Cache-Control' => 'no-cache, must-revalidate',
        'Pragma' => 'no-cache',</b>
        ...
      ) as $key => $value
)
{
    header( $key . ': ' . $value );
}
</pre>

**This guarantees that every request is handled by eZ**

---

title: eZ 5 Cache Directives

Code from `vendor/ezsystems/demobundle/EzSystems/DemoBundle/Controller/DemoController.php`

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="php">
// Setting HTTP cache for the response to be public and with a TTL of 1 day.
$response = new Response;
$response->setPublic();
$response->setSharedMaxAge( 86400 );
// Menu will expire when top location cache expires.
$response->headers->set( 'X-Location-Id', $rootLocationId );
// Menu might vary depending on user permissions, so make the cache vary on the user hash.
$response->setVary( 'X-User-Hash' );
</pre>

**This effectively sets the Response free, out of the reach of eZ**

---

title: Emulating eZ 4 Cache behaviour in eZ 5

This patch to `index.php` disables client and proxy caching without sacrifying the benefits of the Symfony HTTP cache. Use at own risk!

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="php">
$response = $kernel->handle( $request );
<b>
// Emulate eZ 4 cache control
$response->headers->set( 'Cache-Control', 'no-cache, must-revalidate' );
</b>
$response->send();
$kernel->terminate( $request, $response );
</pre>

---

title: Cache Recommendations

* Read the specifications
* Use Shared Caches with caution
* Set TTL values low enough
* Cave: `setTtl()` vs. `setClientTtl`
* For higher traffic sites, use Varnish

* <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#page-74>
* <https://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/>

---

title: Debugging
subtitle: Coping with blank screens
class: segue dark nobackground

---

title: Blank screen, "503 Service not available"

* PHP errors (Syntax error, Memory, Outdated Autoloads, ...)
* Configuration errors (DB connection, ...)

* Switch to DEV mode for better debugging
* Check the log files
<pre>
    Apache/PHP Log
    ezpublish/logs/&lt;env&gt;.log
    ezpublish_legacy/var/log/\*
    ezpublish_legacy/var/&lt;siteaccess&gt;/log/\*
</pre>
* Check write permissions on log files!

---

title: TwigBundle:Exception:error500.html.twig

* NEVER a Twig error!
* Caused by response 500 "Internal Server Error" and missing error template

* Checks as before

---

title: Twig Exception: Invalid variation "&lt;variation&gt;"

Caused by problems when accessing images

* Check if the file exists
* Check permissions on `ezpublish_legacy/var/<siteaccess>/storage`
* Check log files
* Clear cache

---

title: Class 'ezxFormToken' not found

* Usually found with fresh installations involving legacy extensions
* Regenerate Autoloads

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="bash">
$ cd ezpublish_legacy
$ php bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php -e -p
</pre>

---

title: Pitfalls
subtitle: Avoid the traps...
class: segue dark nobackground

---

title: Memory limit exceeded in DEV mode

* DEV mode takes a lot of memory
* Stash Logging is the worst
* Disable Stash Logging in ezpublish.yml

<pre class="prettyprint" data-lang="yml">
stash:
    <b>logging: false</b>
    caches:
        default:
            handlers:
                - FileSystem
            inMemory: true
            registerDoctrineAdapter: false
</pre>

---

title: 414 Request-URI Too Long

When doing subrequests, particularly ESI or Hinclude ones, current SiteAccess is transmitted in a serialized form, with its matcher. With a large number of configured SiteAccesses using Map\Host or Map\URI matcher (around 40, which is not uncommon for a multi-national, multi-lingual site) the URL can exceed the size of 8192 Bytes which most servers accept. As a result, the ESI/Hinclude call fails.

* Fixed in Version 5.3.3 (2014.07)
* <https://jira.ez.no/browse/EZP-23168>
* <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/949>

title: Multi-Site/Multi-Repository Setup
subtitle:
class: segue dark nobackground

---

title: Why a Multi-Site/Multi-Repository Setup?

* At CJW Network we have developed a multi-site/multi-repository setup for eZ Publish 4 several years ago
* This allows us to host many individual sites on a single eZ Publish installation

Advantages:

* Central site administration (site activation, cronjobs, ...)
* Easy deployment (update site extension with Subversion)
* Highly reduced maintenance costs (security patches, upgrades)
* Highly efficient use of hardware resources

Disadvantages:

* Some Kernel patches needed

---

title: Multi-Site/Multi-Repository Setup in eZ 5

First Approach (proven in production)

* Use different `ezpublish` directories to host the different sites

Second approach (under development)

* Use `CJW MultiSiteBundle`

title: Introducing CJW MultiSiteBundle
build_lists: true

Although the first approach works fine, it has several drawbacks:

* Application code scattered at different places (site directory, bundle, legacy extension), hard to maintain in VCS, hard to deploy
* Redundancy in config files
* No global settings
* No central site activation/administration

* Goal: keep everything in one place!

---

title: CJW MultiSiteBundle Features
build_lists: true

* Boots kernel and environment based on domain name mappings
* Handles local, staging and live domain names
* Allows for global activation of bundles
* Allows for global settings
* Provides a common console for all sites
* Caches domain name mappings
* Moves cache and log files away from the ezpublish folder
* more to come ...

    root_dir: %kernel.root_dir%/../../../../ezpublish_legacy
